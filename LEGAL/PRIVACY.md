# Adamancia Vault Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 3, 2026

Adamancia Vault is a focus and blocking app. This policy describes Windows Vault.

## Summary

Adamancia Vault is designed to keep blocking rules and usage state local to your Windows PC by default. The app does not sell personal data, does not display ads, and does not share personal data with data brokers.

## Data Stored Locally

The app may store the following local data on your Windows PC:

- Blocking groups, schedules, timers, freeze/snooze state, and app settings.
- Local web editor storage mirrored from the bundled web interface.
- Local bridge/link state when you connect the Windows app to browser extensions.
- App enforcement policy files used by the Windows blocking engine.

The app keeps its configuration and Classifier data in the current user’s Windows application-data directories.

## Official dictionaries and creator contributions

Vault checks for official term and creator dictionary updates at startup. You choose when to download updates. Creator lookup defaults to a 10,000-entry cache with adjustable capacity; a cache miss sends the public, platform-scoped creator ID to our server. Full-download creator lookup is local. Dictionary downloads and lookups do not require your own AI API key. User-written and user AI-generated definitions remain local and take priority over official definitions. Optional web/AI research uses its separate provider settings.

Help improve the creator dictionary is ON by default. On first launch, a screen explains the feature and lets you disable it before any contribution is sent. You can turn it off at any time in Classifier → Knowledge. When enabled, the app samples missing public creator IDs and their displayed public subscriber/follower counts (which may be rounded); missing counts are sent as unknown. It sends no term names, titles, browsing history, personal definitions, API keys or persistent user/device identifiers. Submissions are deduplicated locally, sampled one in four IDs per day, and capped at 50 per day. Turning it off cancels pending contribution requests and stops future submissions; it does not recall requests already received.

The server retains candidate creator IDs, public counts and last-seen timestamps for seven days after the latest submission. An in-memory, temporary address hash limits abuse and expires hourly; the contribution database stores no IP addresses. Hosting and network providers necessarily process requests. These candidate submissions help prioritize the project-maintained public dictionary; they are distinct from routine cache-miss lookup. Official descriptions are maintained separately and may remain published in future versions.

## Network Use

The app may open a local network listener for its web-app bridge so browser extensions can connect to the Mac app. The app may also make network requests if a bundled feature needs to communicate with Adamancia services, for example optional account or sync-related features.

## Analytics and Ads

The Windows app does not include third-party advertising SDKs. It should not send analytics unless a feature explicitly says it is using an online service.

## Optional Accounts and Sync

If account or sync features are enabled in a release, those features may send the minimum data needed to provide that feature, such as account identity and sync payloads. Downloads and local blocking must not require an account.

## Permissions and removal

Windows Vault uses its user-accessible app inventory, local browser bridge and configured enforcement permissions. Uninstall through the supported Windows app removal flow; local saved configuration can be removed separately.
