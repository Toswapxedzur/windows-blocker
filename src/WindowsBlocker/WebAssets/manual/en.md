# Windows Vault user manual

Windows Vault has three pages: **Vault** blocks native apps, **Classifier** tags supported browser content, and **Activity** shows recorded use. The browser extension collects supported content and applies browser blocking. Install and connect it in the browser you use.

## Quick start

1. In **Vault**, add a blocking group and an Apps target, then select apps with the + picker.
2. Choose the group's blocking behavior and enable it.
3. In **Classifier**, create a group, choose its platforms, and add tags with descriptions.
4. Choose a local model tier and download it if needed. Enable tagging in Classifier settings and resume the group.
5. Open supported content in the connected browser. Configure a tag filter in a browser blocking group if you want the tags to control blocking.

## Blocking groups

A **blocking group** applies a blocking policy. A **Classifier group** assigns tags to content; it does not block anything by itself.

1. Add a blocking group and give it a name.
2. Choose targets under **Applies to**.
3. Choose when blocking applies, then set any schedule or time allowance.
4. Enable the group. Its targets share the group's policy.

Routine edits save automatically. An error means the edit was not accepted; correct the field and try again. Disable a group to stop its policy while keeping its configuration. **Delete group** removes it. Drag groups to reorder them. More than one group can apply to a target; snoozing one does not lift another group's block.

**Export** copies a group configuration. **Import** replaces the selected group's configuration after confirmation.

### Time allowance and schedule

**Block immediately** applies whenever the enabled group matches and its schedule is active. **Block when the time allowance is used** permits matching use until its allowance runs out.

Set the allowance in minutes and the reset interval in hours. A rolling limit counts use within the preceding window. Resetting at midnight starts a new period at local midnight, including for a rolling limit.

Choose active weekdays and optional local-time windows, one per line, such as **09:00-12:00**. An empty window list applies throughout the selected days. A window must end later than it starts on the same day; split an overnight schedule into separate days.

### Snooze

Configure snooze in each blocking group. **Pause blocking** suspends that group's policy for its pause duration. **Add to the time allowance** adds usable minutes to a time-limited group. Only consumed extra allowance counts as snoozed time. Unused extra allowance expires at the next reset; for a rolling limit it expires after one window, or sooner at midnight if enabled.

**Activation delay** postpones snooze while blocking continues. **Cooldown** is the wait after snooze ends before another request. **Required confirmations** sets the number of confirmation steps. Snooze is available on a frozen group only if allowed before freezing.

### Freeze and PIN

**Freeze** prevents routine edits. Unfreezing requires ten confirmations, five seconds apart, plus any configured wait and six-digit PIN. **Wait before unfreezing** accepts 0–72 hours; 0 adds no wait.

While frozen, the wait can be extended and a PIN can be added if none exists. Those conditions cannot be weakened until the group is unfrozen. Deletion also respects the remaining wait and PIN.

### Linked groups

Use **Link** to connect explicitly selected groups in other Vault programs. Linked groups share their name, supported policy settings, targets, usage, and freeze conditions. Each program edits and enforces the target types it supports; other target entries remain available to linked programs. Unlinking keeps each group and its settings.

If a linked member is offline, editing can be unavailable. Open Windows Vault and the linked browser to reconnect. A local saved policy can continue to apply while a member is offline.

## Getting help

Click the small **i** beside a field to see its explanation. Click outside it or press Escape to close it. Lists stay inside scrollable boxes; scroll the box to reach more entries. Search filters the visible list without deleting entries.

Custom rules have their own [Code manual](../code-manual/en.md). It explains the editor, activation, logs, file access, and the supported API.

## Native apps

Use an Apps target's + picker to select installed apps. **Block every app except these** turns the list into an allowlist. System apps, browsers, and Vault itself are excluded from native app blocking.

A blocked app is asked to quit. **Ask a blocked app to quit again every (minutes)** controls retries. Website redirects, page pauses, and feed hiding are enforced by the browser extension; they do not become native app actions.

## Classifier

A Classifier group tags content from its assigned platforms with its own tag tree and model settings. Each platform belongs to one group. Choose platforms when creating the group; they cannot be changed afterward. Blocking-group schedules and filters do not control tagging.

Enable tagging in Classifier settings. Use each group's **Pause tagging / Resume tagging** separately. Turning off a platform feed's recording in **Activity → Recording** also stops its tagging.

### Tags and model settings

Create tags, describe their meanings, and set or remove their parents in the tag tree. Drag a tag to move its branch. Clear descriptions help the model distinguish similar tags. Each group's settings are independent.

- **Speed ↔ Quality** selects a local model tier. Larger models use more memory; speed and results depend on the PC and workload. Downloads are shared across groups.
- **Strict ↔ Broad** sets confidence requirements and default tag counts.
- **Minimum tags / Maximum tags** in More replace those default counts. Strict ↔ Broad still controls confidence for additional tags. Leave either field empty to use its default.
- **Tagging instructions** adds optional instructions for this group.

Routine Classifier edits save automatically. A selected tier must be downloaded before it can tag content. Groups using the same tier share a loaded model; up to two tiers remain loaded at once.

Correct a content item's tags in the browser extension. Click **+ tag**, search the Classifier's existing tags, and choose one to add it. Use a tag's remove control, or select it and press Delete once, to remove it. **Untagged** means tagging finished with no tags; **Tagging** means a result is pending. Corrections inform future tagging.

## Knowledge and web research

Knowledge stores short descriptions on this PC for the local tagging model. **Content sources** include creators, accounts, channels, and communities. Source descriptions accompany their content. **Known terms** apply when a term appears in a title.

Add a source or term and its description, or leave the description empty to request research when enabled. Creator suggestions help find a source the Classifier has collected. Lists with six or more entries have search directly above them: Terms and each platform’s Content sources have separate searches for name, identifier, or description. Editing a description affects future tagging; deleting source knowledge does not prevent later research from recreating it.

### Configure a research provider

1. Open **Classifier settings → API keys & providers**.
2. Choose a provider type and **Add provider**. This creates a configuration; it does not issue an API key.
3. Obtain credentials from that provider and enter them. For a compatible custom endpoint, also configure its endpoint and protocol fields.
4. In **Web research**, choose a provider with built-in web search. Fetch its model list and select a research model. Use the model chooser's search to narrow the list; refresh it to fetch it again.
5. Read the consent disclosure and enable consent. Choose **On**, **Off**, or **Follow Classifier settings** in each group.

**Set up web research…** takes you to settings when configuration is missing. A group cannot bypass research consent. **Test connection** confirms the test request succeeded, not that every model supports research. A provider's test model is separate from the selected research model.

Keys are stored in the app's support folder on this PC, with access restricted to the current Windows user. They authenticate requests to the configured provider; Vault does not upload them to its own server. Research sends sanitized public subjects to the selected provider, not private content bodies or summaries. Read the consent disclosure for the exact fields sent. Provider usage includes connection tests and model-list requests as well as research.

Research status shows queued requests, retry cooldowns, failures, and the day's token usage. **Retry failed subjects now** retries eligible failures; it does not bypass the daily allowance or consent.

## Activity

Activity records enabled app use, website visits, and supported **Content viewed** locally. Its charts reflect recorded data; a blank area does not prove the PC was idle.

Choose a date range. **Timeline** shows use at its time of day; **Totals** sums duration. **Time interval** combines usage within each interval into vertical blocks. **Colors** is a clickable legend: select a source to focus the charts on it. Select a day to view use since that day.

### Activity groups

Create a group to show its selected apps and websites together in Usage. **Merge** uses one name and color for its members throughout Activity. An Activity group organizes recorded use; it is separate from a blocking group or Classifier group. Save the Activity group editor explicitly with **Save**.

### Recording and retention

In **Recording**, turn recording on or off for each category or individual source. **Keep** controls how long history is retained; **Forever** keeps it without an automatic expiry. Individual choices can follow the broader setting. Turning recording off stops new recording; deleting history removes recorded entries.

Platform feeds collect content shown on supported platform pages, whether opened or not. A feed with **Tagging supported** can supply the Classifier while recording is on. Its retention controls collected content separately from app and website usage. A paused Classifier group does not itself turn off recording.

## Classifier settings

**Tag-package updates** selects when verified tag-package updates take effect: **Automatic**, **Ask first**, or **Manual**. It is separate from downloading the local model chosen in a group. Model files download from Hugging Face when you choose **Download**; use the group's progress/status and **Cancel** controls during a download.

Choose the interface language in Settings. Field explanations are available through the small Info buttons in the selected interface language.

## Saving and troubleshooting

Routine Vault and Classifier edits save automatically. Activity group editing uses **Save**. Adding, deleting, downloading a model, testing a connection, and fetching a model list remain explicit actions.

If tags are missing, check the browser connection, global tagging switch, group pause state, platform recording, and model download. If research does not run, check consent, group choice, provider credentials, research model, and the research status. If a linked group cannot be edited, reconnect its programs or unfreeze it as indicated.
